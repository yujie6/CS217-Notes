\section{Bottleneck Paths}

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph with an edge capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \R^+$. For a path
$p = u_0 u_1 \dots u_t$ define its {\em capacity} to be
\begin{align}
   c(p) := \min_{1 \leq i \leq t} c( \{u_{i-1}, u_i\}) \ .
\end{align}

\begin{quotation}
    \textbf{Maximum Capacity Path Problem (MCP).} Given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, an edge capacity function
    $c: E \rightarrow \R^+$, and two vertices $s, t \in V$, compute the path $p^*$ maximizing $c(p)$. We
    denote by $p^*$ the optimal path and by $c^* := c(p^*)$ its cost. 
\end{quotation}



\begin{exercise}
   Suppose the edges $e_1,\dots,e_m$ are sorted by their cost. Show how to solve MCP in time $O(n+m)$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
   Give an algorithm for MCP of running time $O(m \log \log m)$. \textbf{Hint:} Using the median-of-medians algorithm,
   you can determine an edge $e$ such that at most $m/2$ edges are cheaper than $e$ and at most $m/2$ edges are
   more expensive than $e$. Can you determine, in time $O(n+m)$, whether $c^* < c(e)$, $c^* = c(e)$, or $c^* > c(e)$?
   Iterate to shrink the set of possible
    values for $c^*$ to $m/4$, $m/8$, and so on.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
   Give an algorithm for MCP that runs in time $O(m \log \log \log m)$? How about $O(m \log \log \log \log m)$? How far can you get?
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
   Suppose we modify the Ford-Fulkerson method so that, in every round, it finds a path of {\em maximum capacity}, as opposed
   to be shortest-$s-t$-path method employed by Edmonds-Karp. Show that this algorithm terminates after a number of rounds that is 
   polynomial in $n$ and $m$.
\end{exercise}
